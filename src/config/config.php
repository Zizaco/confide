    | is to decide of a member needs to be confirmed before he is able to login
    | so when you set this to true, then a member has to be confirmed before
    | he is able to login, so if you want to use an IPN for confirmation, be
    | sure that the ipn process also changes the confirmed flag in the member
    | table, otherwise they will not be able to login after the payment.
